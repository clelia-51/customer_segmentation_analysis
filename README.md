# Customer Segmentation for Marketing Strategy

## Project Overview

This project applies customer segmentation techniques to identify distinct groups of customers based on their purchasing behavior.

Customer segmentation is a key tool in marketing analytics, as it allows companies to better understand their customers and develop targeted marketing strategies to improve engagement, retention, and revenue.

This project uses clustering methods to group customers with similar characteristics.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project were:

* To analyze customer purchasing behavior
* To identify distinct customer segments
* To support data-driven marketing decision-making
* To demonstrate the use of clustering techniques in marketing analytics

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains customer behavioral variables, including:

* Average order size
* Average order frequency
* Cross-buy behavior
* Multichannel usage
* Marketing contact frequency
* Customer tenure
* Return rate

These variables help describe customer value and engagement.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation

* Loaded and explored the dataset
* Selected relevant variables
* Scaled the data to standardize the variables

### 2. Clustering Analysis

* Used hierarchical clustering to determine the optimal number of clusters
* Identified 6 customer segments
* Applied K-means clustering to assign customers to segments

### 3. Data Visualization

Visualizations were created to:

* Show the distribution of customers across segments
* Understand differences between customer groups

### 4. Export Results

The final segmented dataset was exported for potential marketing use.
